## Project Overview
Vanguard conducted an A/B test to evaluate the impact of a redesigned digital interface on user experience and process completion rates.

## Activities Performed

### Data Cleaning
- Ensured data integrity and consistency.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explored datasets to gain insights into client behavior and experiment outcomes.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Measurement
- **Calculated Conversion Rates:** Distinguished between linear and non-linear completions.
- **Average Time per Step:** Analyzed the time taken by users to complete each step of the process.
- **Error Rate:** Assessed the frequency of errors encountered by users during the process.

### Hypothesis Testing
- Utilized Z-Test, T-Test, Chi-square test to compare completion rates, error rates, and time spent per page between control and test groups.

### Comparison between Variations
- Analyzed whether the variation samples are representative and balanced.

### Dashboards
- **A/B Testing Dashboard**
- **Client Analysis Dashboard**



## Tools & Resources
- Utilized Python for data analysis and manipulation.
- Employed statistical tests for hypothesis testing.
- Leveraged Tableau for data visualization to create insightful and interactive visualizations.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of Vanguard's digital experiment. By analyzing key metrics and conducting hypothesis testing, we gained a deeper understanding of the impact of the redesigned interface on user behavior.
